Interactive Final Draft Due Date: Wednesday, December 7, 2016, start of class


Develop a visual and audio project that reveals hidden biases/perspectives using Processing.  This could be a system that investigates our current reality or that creates a new reality to tell the story of a different perspective â€“ be it a person, an object or a spiritual/technological force.

Possible ideas
- Imagine utopian cyber-future, what would that look like?
- What biases would an Artificial Intelligence have if it were to design a utopia
- Color values from one culture to another, subverting cultural norms and expectations (EG white in China is death, red is lucky)
- Make visuals to go along with a sound that you recorded from contact mic or visuals that are reactive to microphone input
- Create a non-linear story that explores the idea of understanding of event from different perspectives
- Use the arduino to play with user's expectation with interaction with the computer\
- Create a poem generator. Look at the work of Ouilpo. Example http://www.bevrowe.info/Queneau/QueneauRandom_v4.html
- Play with the idea of randomness and order
